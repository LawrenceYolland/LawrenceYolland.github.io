      <h2>A bit of background</h2>

      <p> Between September 2014 and September 2018 I was working on my PhD.
        The nature of the science is such that it can be very difficult for people outside
        the academy to access research. So I figured it might be nice to share what on earth I
        was up to over those <strong>4 long years</strong></p>.

      <p>
        I was a part of a really great inter-disciplinary (and inter-intstitutional) Doctoral Training Programme
        called LIDo. LIDo stands for London Interdisplinary Doctoral Training Programme. Despite being a truly terrible acronym, the
        programme is full of totally excellent people. This London based programme is committed to the idea of colliding researchers with
        vastly different domain expertise to push the boundaries of life science research.
      </p>

      <p>
        My PhD experience certainly fulfilled this LIDo spirit of interdisciplinarity, with supervision coming in the form of Materials Scientist
        <a class="text-link" href="#">Professor Mark Miodownik</a> and Geneticist / Cell Biologist <a class="text-link" href="#">Dr Brian Stramer</a> from UCL and King's College London respectively.
      </p>

      <p>
        For my PhD I was tasked with understanding how cells migrate ... <strong><em> no biggie.</em></strong>
      </p>

      <h2> Cell migration: Why you should care</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Cell migration</strong> is a fundamentlal property of living systems. It's as critical for the development of organisms,
        as it is to the morbidity of many diseases. As such a comprehesive picture of the key contributors to cell motion needs to be established.
        However the field of cell migration, specifically the space I was interested in (the biomechanics bit - <em>I'll explain in a bit ...</em>) has a bit of a secret in that
        we really don't have an idea about how the well understood molecular components combine to produce a complex migrating cell.
        <strong> it magic</strong>
